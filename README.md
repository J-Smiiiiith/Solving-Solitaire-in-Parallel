# Solving Solitaire in Parallel
 
* Commit e362d0165fcb5a825c54d9542a443c7352a39e40 has a full working version of solitaire.
* Note: Invalid moves will result in exceptions being raised and the program crashing. 

* In Commit b16b8c49601569ead6fb9e85a862f66719591964, a Monte Carlo solver was ran 1000 times. This program execution took ~5 hours (on my personal laptop) and resulted in ~53% of games being found to be solvable.
